With Fingachi, taking responsibility for your personal finances has never been more fun or hassle-free. Fingachi can assist you in allocating your income to a budget within your means.

### Overview

"Nearly 7 in 10 Americans have only $1,000 or less in their savings accounts. Out of 7,000 people around the country, 34% of them have nothing at all set aside in savings." [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2016/09/23/survey-69-of-americans-have-less-than-1000-in-savings-infographic/#110147ed1ae6)

Money is oftentimes an uncomfortable subject. Our goal is to make financial responsibility simple, approachable, and interactive.

Backed by market research, Fingachi provides the user with a recommendation of what percentage of their income should be used for fixed costs (rent, food, bills, etc.) and disposable expenses (dining out, entertainment, etc.). 

Your budget is represented by our sprite, Finn. The better you take care of your budget, the happier Finn is. But if you go over your budget, Finn will die.
